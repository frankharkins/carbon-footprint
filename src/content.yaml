      # How do we calculate travel emissions?

      For cars, we estimate ~0.2 kg CO2 per kilometer from assuming [14kg CO2
      emitted per gallon](https://www.carbonindependent.org/17.html), and and
      efficiency of [58 kilometers per
      gallon](https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg).

      For buses and trains, we estimate ~0.1 kg CO2 per kilometer (sources
      [here](https://www.carbonindependent.org/20.html) and
      [here](https://www.carbonindependent.org/21.html)).

      For planes, we estimate ~0.3 kg CO2 per kilometer, also using estimates
      from [carbon independent](https://www.carbonindependent.org/22.html). To
      convert between time and distance, we estimate planes move at
      ~800km/hour.
