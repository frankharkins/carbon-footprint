      # How do we calculate travel emissions?

      We estimate the emissions per mile for each mode of transport and
      multiply it by the distance you enter (converting km to miles if needed).

      For cars, we estimate ~0.22 kg CO2 per kilometer. This comes from the average
      [CO2 emissions per gallon](https://www.carbonindependent.org/17.html),
      divided by the [average miles per gallon in the UK](
      https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg).

      For buses and trains, we estimate ~0.1 kg CO2 per kilometer. We use the
      estimates from [this page](https://www.carbonindependent.org/20.html) and
      [this page](https://www.carbonindependent.org/21.html).

      For planes, we estimate ~0.3 kg CO2 per kilometer, also using estimates
      from [carbon independent](https://www.carbonindependent.org/22.html). To
      convert between time and distance, we estimate planes move at
      ~800km/hour.

  You've finished the calculation, now adjust the sliders to see which variables
  have the biggest effect on your footprint. Can you find three things you can
  realistically change that have the biggest impact?
