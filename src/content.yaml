      ## How do we calculate travel emissions?

      We estimate the emissions per mile for each mode of transport and
      multiply it by the distance you enter (converting km to miles if needed).

      For cars, we estimate ~0.35 kg CO2 per mile. This comes from the average
      [CO2 emissions per gallon](https://www.carbonindependent.org/17.html),
      divided by the [average miles per gallon in the UK](
      https://www.nimblefins.co.uk/cheap-car-insurance/average-mpg).

      For buses and trains, we estimate ~0.1 kg CO2 per mile. We use the
      estimates from [this page](https://www.carbonindependent.org/20.html) and
      [this page](https://www.carbonindependent.org/21.html).

          ]:'
    summary: 'Your diet emits ~%kg of CO2 per year.'

      ## How do we calculate diet emissions?

      We used the mean CO2 equivalent emissions from
      [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325532198_Reducing_food%27s_environmental_impacts_through_producers_and_consumer).

  You've finished the calculation, now adjust the sliders to see which variables
  have the biggest effect on your footprint. Can you find three things you can
  realistically change that have the biggest impact?
