# Carbon footprint calculator

This is a small project to help me learn svelte, and maybe even make something
useful. There are lots of carbon footprint calculators out there, but the idea
here is to show users how their actions change their footprint in real time
(instead of after submitting a form, or re-taking the quiz). This way, hopefully
the user can feel which changes have the biggest impact.

## Running locally

To run locally, first clone the repo, then:

```
cd carbon-footprint
npm install
npm run dev
```

## To do:

- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Add more emission factors
- [ ] Add calculation explanations
- [ ] Publish
